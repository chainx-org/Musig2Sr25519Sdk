# Overview

This is an example of using musig as an aar package. Some help for building a threshold signature wallet for Android.

# Dependencies

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file

```
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

Step 2. Add the dependency
```
dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.chainx-org:musig2-sr25519-android-api:1.2.4'
	}
```

Step 3. Import musig
```
import com.chainx.musig2_sr25519.Mast;
import com.chainx.musig2_sr25519.Musig2;
```

# Api
### Musig2
**getRound1State()**

```java
To get the State of the first round
Returns: State Pointer If the calculation fails just a null pointer will be returned.
```

**getMyPrivkey(phrase)**
```java
Pass in the phrase to get the private key.
Returns: <String>
Return a 32-byte private key key string.
Possible error string returned is `InvalidPhrase`.
```

**getMyPubkey(private)**

```java
Help to get the PublicKey from privkey
Returns: pubkey string Possible errors are Null KeyPair Pointer and Normal Error.
```

**getRound1Msg(state)**

```java
Passed round1 State to generate msg which will broadcast
Returns: msg String. 
Possible errors are Normal Error and Null Round1 State Pointer.
```

**encodeRound1State(state)**

```java
encode State object.
Returns: state String 
Possible error is Null Round1 State Pointer or Encode Fail.
```

**decodeRound1State(round1_state)**

```java
Use string to decode State object.
Returns: State. 
Failure will return a null pointer.
```

**getRound2Msg(state, msg, privkey, pubkeys, received_round1_msg)**

```java
It takes a lot of preparation to switch to round2 state(StatePrime). You need the round1 State, the message to sign for it, your own private key, everyone's public key, and everyone else's msgs from the round1.
Returns: StatePrime Pointer. 
Failure will return a null pointer.
```

**getAggSignature(round2_msg)**

```java
To construct a signature requires the status of the round2 msg about the second round of all other signers, and its own R.
Returns: signature String. 
Possible errors are Normal Error and Null Round2 State Pointer.
```

**getAggPublicKey([pubkeys])**
```java
Pass in the public key to generate the aggregated public key
Returns: pubkey String. 
Possible error is Normal Error.
```

### Mast

**generateThresholdPubkey(pubkeys, threshold)**
```java
Generate threshold signature addresses by passing in 
all signer public keys and signature thresholds.
Returns: <String>
Return the public key of the threshold-signature address.
Possible error string returned is `Invalid Public Bytes`.
```
**generateControlBlock(pubkeys, threshold, aggPubkey)**
```java
Generate a proof of the aggregated public key by 
passing in the public key and signature threshold of 
all signers and the aggregated public key of everyone 
who performed the signature this time.
Returns: <String>
Return signed proofs for transaction validation.
Possible error string returned is `Invalid Public Bytes`.
```

# Example

The specific usage can be viewed in [MainActivity.java](app/src/main/java/com/chainx/musig2sr25519demo/MainActivity.java).This example simulates three people generating aggregated public keys and aggregated signatures.

## Details

### Musig2

- Pass in the phrase to generate private key

~~~java
String privateA = Musig2.getMyPrivkey(phrase1);
~~~

- Pass in the private key to declare a State pointer and get my pubkey

~~~java
long round1StateA = Musig2.getRound1State();
String pubkeyA = Musig2.getMyPubkey(privateA);
~~~

- Use State pointer to  round1 message.

~~~java
String round1MsgA = Musig2.getRound1Msg(round1StateA);
~~~

- Round1 state object serialization

~~~java
String encodedRound1StateA = Musig2.encodeRound1State(round1StateA);
~~~

- Round1 state object deserialization

~~~java
round1StateA = Musig2.decodeRound1State(encodedRound1StateA);
~~~

- Pass the self-generated my_pubkey and round1 message to the other two parties, and the other two parties do the same. In the end, I got the public key and round1 message of the other two parties. Pass in the `getRound2Msg` function to generate my own round2 message. 

~~~java
String round2MsgA = Musig2.getRound2Msg(round1StateA, msg, privateA, pubkeys, new String[]{round1MsgB, round1MsgC});
~~~

- Pass the round1 message to the other two parties, and I can finally generate the signature by `getAggSignature`. 

~~~java
String sig = Musig2.getAggSignature(new String[]{round2MsgA, round2MsgB, round2MsgC});
~~~

- When I obtain the public keys of the other two parties, I can generate the aggregate public key. 

~~~java
String pubkey = Musig2.getAggPublicKey(pubkeys);
~~~


### Mast

- The threshold signature address can be generated by using the threshold and the public key of the all participant.

~~~java
String thresholdPubkey = Mast.generateThresholdPubkey(new String[]{publicA, publicB, publicC}, (byte) 2);
~~~

- Using the threshold, the public keys of all participants and the aggregation of the public keys can generate a proof.

~~~java
String control = Mast.generateControlBlock(new String[]{publicA, publicB, publicC}, (byte) 2, publicAB);
~~~
